            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I've been shaping web experiences for over 15 years.
                From Fortune 100 companies like Intel to startups and
                nonprofits, I've applied my expertise to hundreds of
                websites and web apps. My focus? Crafting seamless
                user experiences using JavaScript/ES6, React, Rest
                APIs, MySQL, HTML, and CSS/SCSS. My colleagues value
                my technical skills, design sensibility, and ability
                to communicate effectively. Based in sunny Petaluma,
                California, I blend work with local life, travel, and
                photography. Let's build something amazing together!
