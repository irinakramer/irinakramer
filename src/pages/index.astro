            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I’m an experienced frontend Engineer based in charming
                Petaluma, California. I have been in the web industry
                for over 15 years and contributed to hundreds of
                enterprise and eCommerce websites and web apps,
                focusing on optimal user experience and performance.
                Most recently I was at a fintech company building bank
                statement analysis web app.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thrive on bringing the vision of design into live
                functioning applications. My tech stack is
                JavaScript/ES6, React, REST/GraphQL APIs, MySQL, HTML,
                CSS/SCSS, and I’m learning Next.js.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m currently available for part-time or contract
                frontend opportunities.
            </p>
